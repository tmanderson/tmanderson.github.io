# Thought #1
## Thinking about some identities

In looking over the trigonometric functions today, I managed to find something that made me think about it in a clearer manner. There's no better way to explain something than with an example -- so without further ado:

We'll use the addition of the two sin waves in this example:

<figure>
$$
    \sin\alpha + \sin\beta = 2\sin(\frac{1}{2}(\alpha+\beta))\cos(\frac{1}{2}(\alpha-\beta))
$$
</figure>

If we think of the angles $\alpha$ and $\beta$ as vectors instead:

<figure>
<div style="width:49%;display:inline-block;">
$$
    \alpha = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \alpha_x \\newline
        \alpha_y
    \end{bmatrix} =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \cos\alpha \\newline
        \sin\alpha
    \end{bmatrix}
$$
</div>
<div style="width:49%;display:inline-block;">
$$
    \beta = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \beta_x \\newline
        \beta_y
    \end{bmatrix} =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \cos\beta \\newline
        \sin\beta
    \end{bmatrix}
$$
</div>
</figure>

Now if adapt this style of thinking to the entire identity, then any $\sin$ term can be seen as only operating on the *y-components* of both "vectors". The "translation" of the identity's $\sin$ and $\cos$ component could then be thought of as:

<figure>
    <div style="width:49%;display:inline-block;">
    $$ \sin(\frac{1}{2}(\alpha+\beta)) = \frac{1}{2}(\alpha_y+\beta_y) $$
    </div>
    <div style="width:49%;display:inline-block;">
    $$ \cos(\frac{1}{2}(\alpha-\beta)) = \frac{1}{2}(\alpha_x-\beta_x) $$
    </div>
</figure>

I feel that this kind of points out a lot of underlying points that the mangled identity expression (which is typically the one shown) just doesn't. However, it cannot be argued that is (potentially) more concise ~~and easier to memorize~~. Once I had this thought out, I could then easily see why this identity held the values that it did. From this one can then think of $\sin$ as "extracting the y-component" and $\cos$ as "extracting the x-component."

To take the last figure above, doesn't it make sense that the *addition* of two *sine* waves would be an *average* of the summed *y-components*? Then it would follow that since we are *adding y-components* that we will almost certainly be *losing* ground on our *x-component*.

With the more crowded parts out of the way, the rest of the should be simple to complete calculation -- I'll see if I can't run through the rest of it in this manner (and possibly more applications)
