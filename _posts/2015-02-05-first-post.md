## Chapter 3 - The Laws of Motion
### By Isaac Asimov

### Inertia

[Galileo]'s work on falling bodies was systematized a century later by the English scientist [Isaac Newton](Newton), who was born, people are fond of pointing out, in the year of Gallileo's death.

[Newton](Newton)'s systematization appeared in his book *Pilisophiae naturalis principia mathematica* (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy) published in 1687. The book is usually referred to simply as the Principia.

[Aristotle]'s picture of the physical had been lying shattered for nearly a hundred years, and it was [Newton](Newton) who now replaced it with a new one, more subtle and more useful. The foundations of the new picture of the universe consisted of three generalizations concerning motion that are usually referred to as [Newton](Newton)'s Three Laws of Motion.^[1]

His first law of motion may be given thus:
> A body remains at rest or, if already in motion, remains in uniform motion with  constant speed in a straight line, unless it is acted upon by an unblanaced external
> force.

As you can see, this first law runs counter to the Aristotelian assumption of "natural place" with its corollary that the natural state of an object is to be at rest in its natural place.

The Newtonian view is that there is no natural place for any object. Wherever an object happens to be at rest^2 without any force acting upon it, will remain at rest. Furthermore, if it happens to be in motion without any force acting upon it, it will remain in motion ofrever and show no tendency at all to come to rest. (I am not defining "force" just yet, but you undoubtedly already have a rough idea of what it means, and a propert definition will come eventually).

This tendency for motion (or for rest) to maintain itself steady unless made to do otherwise by some interfereing force can be viewed as a kind of "laziness," a kind of unwillingness to make a change. And indeed the first law of motion is referred to as the principle of *intertia*, from the Latin word meaning "idleness" of "laziness."

At first glance, the principle of inertia does not seem nearly as self-evident as the Aristotelian assumption of "natural place." We can see with our own eyes that moving objects do indeed tend to come to a halt even when, as nearly as we can see, there is nothing to stop them. Again, if a stone is released in midair it starts moving and continues moving at a faster and faster rate, even though, as nearly as we can see, there is nothing to set it into motion.

If the principle of intertia is to hold good, we ust be willing to admin the presence of subtle forces that do not make their existence very obvious.

For instance, a hokey puck given a sharp push along a level cement sidewalk will travel in a straight line, to be sure, but will do so at a quickly decreasing velocity and soon come to a halt. IF the same puck is given a sharp push along a smooth layer of ice, it will travel much futher, again in a straight line, abut this time at only a slowly decreasing velocity. If we experiment sufficiently, it will quickly become clear that the rougher the surface along which the puck travels, the more quickly it will come to a halt.

It would seem that the tiny unevennesses of the rough surface catch at the tiny unevennesses of the hocky puck slow it up. This catching of unevennesses against unevennesses is called *friction* (from the Latin word meaning "rub"), and the friction acts as a force that slows the puck's motion. The less the friction, the smaller the frictional force and the more sloly the puck's velocity is decreased. On a very smooth surface, such as that of ice, friction is so low that a puck would travel for great distances. If one could imagin a horizontal surface with no friction at all, then the hockey puck would travel in a straight line at constant velocity forever.

The Newtonian principle of inertia therefor holds exactly only in an imaginary ideal world in which no interfering forces exist: no friction, no air resistance.

Next consider a rock held in midair. It is at rest, but the instant we let it go it begins to move. Clearly, then, there must be some force that makes it move, since the principle of inertia requires that in the absence of a force it remain at rest. Since the motion of the rock, if merely released, is always in the direction of the earth, the force must be exerted in that direction. Since the property that makes a rock fall had long been spoken of as "gravity," it was natural to call the force that brough about the motion *gravitational force* or *force of gravity*.

It would therefore seem that the principle of inertia depends upon a circular argument. We begin by stating the body will behae in a certain way unless a force is acting on it. Then, wehenver it turns out that a body does not behave in this way, we invent a force to account for it.

Such circular argumentatin would be bad indeed if we set about trying to prove [Newton](Newton)'s first law, but we do not do this. [Newton](Newton)'s laws of motion represent assumptions and definitions and are not subject to proof. In particular, the notion of "inertia" is as much an assumption as [Aristotle]'s notion of "natural place." There is this difference between them however: The principle of inertia has proved extremely useful in the study of physics for nearly three centuries now and has involved physicists in no contradictions. For this reason (and not out of any considerations of "truth") physicists hold on to the laws of motion and will continue to do so.

To be sure, the new relativeistic view of the universe advanced by Einstein makes it plain that in some respects [Newton](Newton)'s laws of motion are only appoximations. At very great velocities over very great distances, the approximations depart from reality by a considerable amount. At ordinary velocities and distance, however, the approximations are extremely good^[3].

### Forces and Vectors

The term *force* comes from the Latin word for "strength," and we know its common meaning when we speak of the "force of circumstance" or the "force of argument" or "military force." In physics, however, force is defined by [Newton](Newton)'s laws of motion. A force is that which can impose a change of velocity on a material body.

We are conscious of such forces, usually (but not always), as muscular effort. We are conscious, furthermore, that they can be exerted in definite directions. For instance, we can exert a force on an objet at rest in such a way as to cause it to move away from us. Or we can exert a similar force in such a way as to cause it to move toward us. The forces are clearly exerted in different directions, and in common speech we give such forces *push*; one directed toward ourselves is a *pull*. For this reason, a force is sometimes defined as "a push or pull," but this is actually no definition at all, for it only tells us that a force is either one kind of force or another kind of force.

A quantity that has both size and direction, as a force does, is a *vector quantity*, or simple a *vector*. One that has size only is a *scalar quanitity*. For instance, distance is usually treated as a scalar quantity. An automobile can be said to have traveled a distance of 15 miles regardless of the direction in which it was traveling.

On the other hand, under certain conditions direction odes make a difference when it is combined with the size of the distance. If town B is 15 miles north of town A, then it is not enough to direct a motorist to travel 15 miles to reach town B. The direction must be specified. If he travels 15 miles north, he will get there; if he travels 15 miles east (or any direction other than north), he will not. If we call a combination of size and dirction of distance traveled *displacement*, then we can say that displacement is a vector.

The importance of differentiating between vectors and scalars is that the two are manipulated differently. For instance, in adding scalars it is sufficient to use the ordinary addition taught in grade school. If you travel 15 miles in one direction, then travel 15 miles in another direction, the total distance you travel is 15 plus 15, or 30 miles. Whatever the directions, the total mileage is 30.

If you travel 15 miles north, then another 15 miles north, the total displacement is, to be sure 30 miles north. Suppose, however, that you trabeled 15 miles norht, then 15 miles east. What is your total displacement? How far, in other words, are you from your starting point? The total distance traveled is still 30 miles, but your final displacement is 21.2 miles northeast. If you travel 15 miles norht and then 15 miles south, you have still traveled 30 miles altogether, but your total displacement is 0 miles, for you are back at your starting point.

So there is both ordinary addition, involving scalars, and *vector addition*, invoving vectors. In ordinary addition 15 + 15 is always 30; in vector addition 15 + 15 can be anything from 0 to 30, depending on the circumstances.

Since force is a vector, two forces are added together according to the principles of vector addition. If one force is applied to a body in one direction and an exactly equal force is applied in the opposite direction, the sum of the two forces is zero; in such a case, even though forces are involved, a body subjected to them does not change its velocity. If it is at rest, it remains at rest. In fact, in every case where a body is at rest in the real world, we can feel certain this does not mean there are no forces present to set it into motion. There are *always* forces present (the force of gravitation, if nothing else). If there is rest, or unchanging velocity, that is because there is more than one force present and because the vector sum of all the forces involved is zero.

If the vector sum of all forces involved is *not* zero, then there is an unbalanced force (mentioned in my definition of [Newton](Newton)'s first law), or a net force. Whenever I speak of a force exerted on a body, it is to be understood that I mean a net force.

A particular force may have one of several effects on a moving body. The force of gravity, for instance, is directed downward twoard the ground, and a falling body, moving in the direction of the gravitational pull, travels at a greater and greater velocity, undergoing and acceleration of 9.8 m/s^2.

A body propelled upard, however, is moving in a direction opposite to that of the force of gravity. Consequently, it seems to be dragged backward by the force, moving more and more slowly. It finally comes to a halt, reverses its direction, and begins to fall. Such a slowing of velocity may be called a "deceleration" or "negative acceleration." However, it would be convenient if a particular force was always considered to produce a particular acceleration. To avoid speaking of negative acceleration, we can instead speak of negative velocity.

In other words, let us consider velocity to be a vector. This means that the movement of 40 m/sec downward cannot be considered the same as a movement of 40 m/sec upward. The easiest way to distinguish between opposite quantities is to consider one positive and the other negative. Therefore, let us say that the downward motion is +40 m/sec and the upward one is -40 m/sec.

Since a downward force produces a downward acceleration^[4] (accelerating being a vector, too), we can express the size of the acceleration due to gravity not as merely 9.8 m/sec, but as +9.8 m/sec.

If a body is moving at +40 m/sec (downward, in other words), the effect of acceleration is to increase the size of the figure. Adding two positive numbers by vector addition gives results similar to those of ordinary addition; therefore, after one second, the body is moving +49.8 m/sec, after another second, +56.6 m/sec, and so on. If, on the other hand, a body is moving at -40 m/sec (upward), the vector addition of a positive quantity resembles ordinary subtraction, as far as the figure itself is concerned. After one second, the body will be traveling -30.2 m/sec; after two seconds -20.4 m/sec; and after four seconds -0.8 m/sec. Shortly after the four-second mark, the body will reach a velocity of 0 m/sec, and at that point it will come to a momentary halt. It will then begin to fall, and after five seconds its velocity will be +9.0 m/sec.

As can be seen, the acceleration produced by the force of gravity is the same whether the body is moving upward or downward, and yet there is something that is different in the two cases. The body covers more and more distance each second of its downward movement, but less and less distance each second of its upward movement. The amount of distance covered per unit time can be called the velocity or speed of the body.

In ordinary speech speed and velocity are synonymous, but not so in physics. Speed is a scalar quantity and does not involve direction. An object moving 16 m/sec north is traveling at the same speed as one moving at 16 m/sec east, but the two are traveling at different velocities. In fact, it is possible under certain circumstances to arrange a force so as to cause it to make a body move in circles. The speed, in that case, might not change at all, but the velocity (which includes direction) would constantly be changing.

Of the two terms, velocity is much more frequently used by physicists, for it is the broader and more convenient term. For instance, we might define a force as "that which imposes a change in the speed of a body, or its direction of motion, or both." Or we might define it as "that which imposes a change in the velocity of a body," a briefer but as fully meaningful phrase.

Since a change in velocity is an acceleration, we might also define a force as "that which imposes an acceleration on a body, the acceleration and force being in the same direction."

### Mass

[Newton](Newton)'s first law explains the concept of a force, but something needed to allow us to measure the strength of a force. If we define a force as something that produces and acceleration, it would seem logical to measure the size of a force by the size of the acceleration it brings about. When we restrict ourselves to one particular body, say a basketball, this makes sense. If we push the basketball along the ground with a constant force, it moves more and more quickly, and after ten seconds it moves with a celocity, let us say, of 2 m/sec. Its acceleration is 2 m/sec divided by 10 seconds, or 0.2 m/sec^2. If you start from scratch and do not push quite as hard, at the end of ten seconds the basketball may be moving only 1 m/sec; it will therefore have undergone an acceleration of 0.1 m/sec^2. Since the acceleration is twice as great in the first case, it seems fair to suppose that the force was twice as great in the first case as in the second.

But if you were to apply the same forces to a solid cannonball instead of a basketball, the cannonball will not undergo anything like the previously noted accelerations. It might well take every scrap of force you can exert to get the cannonball to move at all.

Again, when a basketball is rolling along at 2 m/sec, you can stop it easily enough. The velocity change from 2 m/sec to 0 m/sec requires a force to bring it about, and you can feel yourself capable of exerting sufficient force to stop the basketball. Or you can kick the basketball in mid-motion and cause it to veer in direction. A cannonball moving at 2 m/sec, however, can only be stopped by great exertion and if it is kicked in mid-motion it will change its direction by only a tiny amount.

A cannonball, in other words, behaves as though it posses more inertia[TMA:haha - cannonballs are lazy!] than a basketball and therefore requires correspondingly more force for the production of a given acceleration. [Newton](Newton) used the word *mass* to indicate the quantity of inertia possessed by a body, and his second law of motion states:
> The acceleration produced by a particular force acting on a body is directly proportional to the
> magnitude of the force and inversely proportional to the mass of the body.

Now I have already explained that when x is said to be directly proportional to y, then x = ky (see page 19). However, in saying that x is inversely proportional to another quantity, say z, we mean that as z increases x decreases by a corresponding amount and vice versa. Thus if z is increased threefold, x is reduced to 1/3; if z is increased elevenfold x is reduced to 1/11, and so on. Mathematically, this notion of an inverse proportion is most simply expressed as x∝1/z, for then when z is 3, x is 1/3; when z is doubled to 6, x is halved to 1/6, and so on. We can change the proportionality to an equality by multiplying by a constant, so that if x is inversely proportional to z, x=k/z. If x is both directly proportional to y and inversely proportional to z, then x=ky/z.

With this in mind, let's have a represent the acceleration, f the magnitude of the force and m the mass of the body. We can then represent [Newton](Newton)'s second law of motion as:

<figure>
$$
    a = \frac{kf}{m}
$$
<figcaption>Equation 3-1</figcaption>
</figure>

Let us consider the units in which we will measure each quantity, turning to mass first, since we have not yet taken it into account in this book. You may think that if I say a cannonball is more massive than a basketball, I mean it is heavier. Actually, I do not. "Massie" is not the same as "heavy," and "mass" is not the same as "weight," as I shall explain later in the book. Nevertheless, there is a certain similarity between the two concepts and they are easily confused. In common experience, as bodies grow heavier they also grow more massive, and physicists have compounded the chance of confusion by using units of mass of a sort which nonphysicists usually think of as units of weight.

In the metric system, two common units for mass are the *gram* (fm) and the *kilogram* (kg). A gram is a small unit of mass. A quart of milk has a mass of about 975 grams, for example. The kilogram, as you might expect from the prefix, is equal to 1000 gm and represents, therefore, a trifle more than the mass of a quart of milk.

(In common units, mass is frequently presented in terms of "ounces" and "pounds," these units also being used for weight. In this book, however, I shall confine myself to the metric sustem as far as possible, and shall use common units, quarts, for example only when they are needed for clarity.)

In measuring the magnitude of a force, two quantities must be considered: acceleration and mass. Using metric units, acceleration is most commonly measured as m/sec^2 or cm/sec^2, while mass may be measured in gm or kg. Concentionally, whenever distance is given in meters, the mass is given in kilograms, both being comparatively large units. On the other hand, whenever distance is given in the comparatively small centimeters, mass is given in the comparatively small grams. In either case, the unit of time is the second.

Consequently, the units of may physical quantities may be compunded of centimeters, grams, and seconds in various combinations; or meters, kilograms and seconds in various combinations. The former is referred to as the *cgs system*, the latter is the *mks system*. A generation or so ago, the cgs system was the more frequently used of the two, but now the mks system has gained popularity. In this book, I will use both systems.

In the cgs system, a unit force is described as one that produce an acceleration of 1 cm/sec^2 on a mass of 1 gm. A unit force is therefore 1cm/sec^2 multiplied by 1 gm. (In multiplying the two algebraic quantities a and b, we can express the product simply as $ab$. We manipulate units as we would algebraic quantities, but to join words together directly would be confusing, so I will make use of a hyphen, which, after all, is commonly used to join words.) The product of 1 cm/sec^2 and 1 gm is therefore 1 gm-cm/sec^2 – the magnitude of the unit force. The unit of force, gm-cm/sec^2, is frequently used by physicists, but since it is an unwieldy mouthful, it is more briefly expressed as the *dyne* (From the Greek word for "force").

Now let's solve Equation 3-1 for $k$. This works out to:
<figure>
$$
    k=\frac{ma}{f}
$$
<figcaption>Equation 3-2</figcaption>
</figure>

The value of $k$ is the same for any consistent set of values of $a, m$, and $f$, so we may as well take simple ones. Suppose we set *m* equal to 1 gm and $a$ equal to 1 cm/sec^2. The amount of force that corresponds to such a mass and acceleration is, by our definition, 1 gm-cm/sec^2 (or 1 dyne).

Inserting these values into Equation 3-2, we find that:

<figure>
$$
    k = \frac{1\ \text{gm} \times 1\ \text{cm/sec}^2}{1\ \text{gm-cm/sec}^2} = \frac{1\ \text{gm-cm/sec}^2}{1\ \text{gm-cm/sec}^2} = 1
$$
</figure>

In this case, at least, $k$ is a pure number. Since $k$ is equal to 1, we find that Equation 3-2 can be written as $ma$ / $f$=1, and therefore:

<figure>
$$
    f = ma
$$
<figcaption>Equation 3-3</figcaption>
</figure>

*provided* we use the proper sets of units – that is, if we measure mass in gm, acceleration in cm/sec^2, and force in dynes.

In the mks system of measurement, acceleration is measured in m/sec^2 and mass in kg. The unit of force is then defined as that amount of force which will produce an acceleration of 1 meter per second per second when applied to 1 kilogram of mass. The unit force in this system is therefore 1 m/sec^2 multiplied by 1 kg, or 1 kg-m/sec^2. This unit of force is stated more briefly as 1 *newton* in honor of [Isaac Newton](Newton), of course. Equation 3-3 is still true, then, for a second combination of consistent units -- where mass is measured in kg, acceleration in m/sec^2, and force in Newtons.

From the fact that a kilogram is equal to 1000 grams and that a meter is equal to 100 centimeters, it follows that 1 kg-m/sec^2 is equal to (1000 gm) (100 cm)/sec^2, or 100,000 gm-cm/sec^2. To put it more compactly, 1 newton = 100,000 dynes.

Before leaving the second law of motion, let's consider the case of a body subject to no net force at all. In this case we can say that $f=0$, so that Equation 3-3 becomes $ma=0$. But any material body must have a mass greater than 0, so the only way in which $ma$ can equal 0, is to have $a$ itself equal 0.

In other words, if no net force acts on a body, it undergoes no acceleration and must therefore either be at rest or traveling at a constant belocity.

This last remark, however, is an expression of [Newton](Newton)'s first law of motion. It follows, then, that the second law of motion includes the first law as a *special case*. If the second law is stated and accepted, there is no need for the first law. The value of the first law is largely psychological. The special case of $f=0$, once accepted, frees the mind of the "common-sense" Aristotelian notion that it is the natural tendency of objects to come to rest. With the mind thus freed, the general case can then be considered.

### Action and Reaction

A froce, to exist, must be exerted by something and upon something. It is obvious that something cannot be pushed unless something else is pushing. It should also be obvious that something cannot push unless there is something else to be pushed. You cannot imagine pushing or pulling a vacuum.

A force, then, connects two bodies, and the question arises to which body is pushing and which is being pushed. When a living organism is involved, we are used to thinking of the organism as originating the force. We think ourselves as pushing the cannonball and of a horse as pulling a wagon, not of the cannonball as pushing us or the wagon as pulling the horse.

Where to inanimate objects are concerned, we cannot be so certain. A stell ball falling upon a marble floor is going to push against the floor when it strikes and therefore extert a force upon it. On the other hand, since the steel ball bounces, the floor must have exerted a force upon the ball. Whereas the force of the ball was exerted downward onto the floor, the force of the floor was exerted upward onto the ball.

In this and in may other similar cases there would seem to be two forces, equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. [Newton](Newton) made the generalizatino that this was always and necessarily true in all cases and expressed it in his third law of motion. This is often stated very briefly: "For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction." It is for that reason that the third law is sometimes referred to as the "law of action and reaction."

Perhaps, however, this is not the best way of putting it. By speaking of action and reaction, we are still thinking of a living object exerting a force on some inanimate object that then responds automatically. Once force (the "action") seems to be more important and to precede in time the other force (the "reaction").

But this is not so. The two forces are of exactly equal importance (from the standpoint of physics) and exist simultaneously. Either can be viewed as the "action" or the "reaction." It would be better, therefore, to state the law something like this:

> Whenever one body exerts a force on a second body, the second body exerts a force on the first body. These forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

So phrased, the law can be called the "law of interaction." The third law of motion can cause confusion. People tend to ask: "If every force involves an equal and opposite counterforce, why don't the two forces always cancel out by vector addition, leaving no net force at all?" (If that were so, then acceleration would be impossible and the second law would be meaningless.)

The answer is that two equal and opposite forces cancel out by vector addition when they are exerted on the same body. If a force were exerted on a particular rock and an equal and opposite force were also exerted on that same rock there would be no net force; the rock, if at rest, would remain at rest no matter how large each force was. (The forces might be large enough to crush the rock to powder, but they wouldn't move the rock.)

The law of ineraction, however, involves equal and opposite forces exerted on _two separate bodies_. Thus, if you exert a force on a rock, the equal and opposite force is exerted by the rock on you; the rock and you each receive a single unbalanced force. If you exert a force on a rock and let go of it at the same time, the rock, in response to this single force, is accelerated in the direction of that force -- that is, away from you. The second force is exerted on you, and you in turn accelerate in the direction of that second force -- that is, in the direction opposite to that in which the rock went flying. Ordinarily, you are standing on rough ground and the friction between your shoes and the ground (accentuated, perhaps, by muscular bracing) introduces new forces that keep you from moving. Your acceleration is therefore masked, so the tru effect of the law of interaction may go unnoticed. However, if you were standing on a very smooth, slippery ice and hurled a heavy rock eastward, you would go sliding westward.

In the same way, the gases formed by the burning fuel in a rocket engine expand and exert a force against the interior walls of the engine, while the walls of the engine exert an equal and opposite force against the gasses. The gases are forced into an acceleration downward, so that the walls (and the attached rocket) are forced into an acceleration upward. Every rocket that rises into the air is evidence of the validity of [Newton](Newton)'s third law of motion.

In these cases, the two objects involved are physically separate, or can be physically separated. One body can accelerate in oone direction and the other in the opposite direction. But what of the case where the two bodies involved are bound together? What of a horse pulling a wagon? the wagon also pulls the horse in the opposite direction with an equal force. Yet horse and wagon do not accelerate in opposite directions. They are hitched together and both move in the same direction.

If the forces connecting wagon and horse were the only ones involved, there would indeed be no overall movement. A wagon and horse on very slippery ice would get nowhere, no matter how the horse might flounder. On ordinary ground, there are frictional effects. The horse exerts a force on the earth and the earth exerts a counterforce on the horse (and its attached wagon). Consequently, the horse moves forward and the earth moves backward.

The earth is so much more massibe than the horse that its acceleration backward (remember that the acceleration produced by a force is inversely proportionate to the mass of the body being accelerated) is completely unmeasurable. We are aware only of the horse's motion, and so it seems to us that the horse is pulling th wagon. We find it hard to imagine that the wagon is also pulling at the horse.

[1]: The important generalizations of science are brief descriptions of the behavior of the universe that are known to cover all observed cases. It is strongly felt that they will also cover all unobserved cases, here or anywhere, now or at any time. Such generalizations are sometimes called "laws of nature." This is actually a poor phrase because it seems to draw analogy with man-made law, as something that is imposed and can be repealed, that can be violated at the cost of a penalty, and so on. All such analogies are misleading. It would be better therefore to speak of "[Newton](Newton)'s generalizations concerning motion." However, everybody calls them the "laws" of motion and if I did otherwise, I would merely seem eccentric. Nevertheless, by this footnote you are warned.

[3]: It is sometimes said that Einstein's view of the universe is "disproved" [Newton](Newton)'s view. This is too simple a view. Actually Einstein's view is more useful over a wider range of circumstances. Under ordinary circumstances, however, the Einsteinian view works out to be just about identical with the Newtonian view. In this book ordinary circumstances only will be involved, and it will not be necessary to introduce relativity.

[4]: We know from experience that if we push any object away from us, it moves away from us; if it is already moving, it moves away more rapidly. In the same way, to stop a moving body we always exert a force in the direction opposite to its motion. Experience tells us that the acceleration produced by a force is in the same direction as the force.
