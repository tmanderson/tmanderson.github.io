description: 'These days it\'s not too easy for an adult to further their education.
  Beyond that of "professional" degree programs, there just aren\'t a whole lot of
  reasonable options for the curious common-man of "post-collegiate age." While it\'s
  a shame, I\'d hate for it to be so much a hinderance as to blind me completely of
  everything around us. To create, one must know and to know one must learn.'
